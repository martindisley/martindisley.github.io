<p>Technologically mediated participatory art-forms often call into question the ontological distinctions of performer and audience. The process where by the one-way channel of information from performer to audience is interrupted through the incorporation of a meta-communicative reversal of roles.</p>

<p>â€˜still in the moveâ€™ is an interactive audio-visual installation for single audience-participant that invites the user to create and warp acousmatic sound through their conscious proprioceptive positioning and movement.</p>

<p>The term â€˜audience-participantâ€™ is explored by two features of the installation. First, through the â€˜macro narrativeâ€™ of the participant. The participant is meant to both engage with the system themselves and watch others engage with it. In this way they are both a participant of, and an audience to the installation. The installation is to be experienced first as an audience (witnessing a performance), then engaging with the system (participating), and eventually returning to audience in a new context.</p>

<p>The â€˜contextâ€™ here frames the second use of the term. The â€˜micro narrativeâ€™ of the participant; the installation will not respond like a musical instrument, the system nor the participant holds dominion over one or other. In this way the participant is an audience to the sonic reciprocation their actions.</p>
