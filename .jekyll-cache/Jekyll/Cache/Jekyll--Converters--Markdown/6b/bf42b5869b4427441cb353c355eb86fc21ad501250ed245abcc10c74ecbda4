I"Ð<p>â€˜A Resonant Huskâ€™ is an electro-acoustic composition for four speakers, evoking the desolation and â€˜un-silenceâ€™ of a biologically impoverished world. The source material - the creaking of melting ice; the hum of industrial shipping; the trembling of ferric debris - was recorded using hydrophones built by the artist following instructions outlined in a paper in the <a href="http://asa.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1121/1.3573502?class=pdf">Journal of Animal Bioacoustics</a>, originally designed as a non-invasive method of  cetacean population estimation. Through their replication and appropriation for aesthetic ends, the work seeks to alloy noise pollution and biodiversity loss in the mind of the listener.</p>

<p>â€˜A Resonant Huskâ€™ was commisioned by the climate-breakdown protest group Extinction Rebellion and it featured in their curated <a href="https://festival19.summerhall.co.uk/exhibition/extinction-rebellion/">month-long exhibition at Summerhall, Edinburgh</a> as part of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.</p>
