The Venice and Ghent based experimental music label [Rest Now!](https://www.takearestnow.com/releases) asked 21 producers to rescore the Die Hard OST for its 20th anniversary, I was very pleased to be one of them. You can hear my contribution below under the moniker [Le Combat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_(newspaper)). This is the debut release for this project.
