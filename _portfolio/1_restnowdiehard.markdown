[Le Combat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_(newspaper)) is the vehicle for my ambient/electronic composition. Rest Now! asked 21 producers to rescore the Die Hard OST for its 20th anniversary and I was very pleased to be one of them. You can hear my contribution below. This is the debut release for this project, with more to come very soon.
