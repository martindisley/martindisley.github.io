‘A Resonant Husk’ is an electro-acoustic composition for four speakers, evoking the desolation and ‘un-silence’ of a biologically impoverished world. The source material - the creaking of melting ice; the hum of industrial shipping; the trembling of ferric debris - was recorded using hydrophones built by the artist following instructions outlined in a paper in the Journal of Animal Bioacoustics, originally designed as a non-invasive method of  cetacean population estimation. Through their replication and appropriation for aesthetic ends, the work seeks to alloy noise pollution and biodiversity loss in the mind of the listener.

'A Resonant Husk' was commisioned by the protest group Extinction Rebellion and it featured in their curated [month-long exhibition at Summerhall, Edinburgh](https://festival19.summerhall.co.uk/exhibition/extinction-rebellion/) as part of the Edinburgh Summer Festivals.
