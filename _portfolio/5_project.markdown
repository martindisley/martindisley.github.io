[Le Combat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_(newspaper)) is the vehicle for my  non-academic ambient/electronic music. The debut appears on this compilation from Rest Now! (Venice, Italy). Rest Now! Asked 21 producers to rescore the Die Hard OST for its 20th anniversary. You can hear my contribution below.
