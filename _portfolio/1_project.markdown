A twitter bot that periodically pulls and tweets entries from [The List](https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2018/06/19/TheList.pdf), a record compiled by the network [United for Intercultural Action](unitedagainstracism.org) of every reported instance in which someone has died trying to migrate into Europe.

For a while I had been wanting to use twitter as medium for some digital arts project, so I'd briefly messed around with the API. That never really came to anything and then months later I read an article about this list (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/the-list-europe-migrant-bodycount …). Every attempt to communicate this information I had seen online seemed to be adept at communicating scale, but scale often comes at the loss of detail, the ‘detail’ here being the lives of individuals. I though a twitter bot might be an interesting way to present this detail. There are lots of other metaphorical leaps I could make about it but I don’t want to get too contrived. I built it myself, with a little help from a friend to set up the server. It’s not for anyone really and it’s not in anyway affiliated with UNITED.

It pulls out randomly though. The point is not that it should be delivering 'news' in any sense, it's not meant to be a "whose the latest to die" counter. Rather it's meant to reaffirm that the loss of that single individual (who has randomly appeared in your timeline) is as valuable as any other and that this value is not to be diminished by the ostensive homogeneity of the 'group'.
