Every project has a beautiful feature shocase page. It's easy to include images, in a flexible 3-column grid format. Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so: 


    
<a class="twitter-timeline" href="https://twitter.com/TheListTweeted?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Tweets by TheListTweeted</a> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
