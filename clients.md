As part of the Creative Informatics Resident Entrepreneur programme working with the National Library of Scotland (NLS), I developed a suite of creative machine learning services with applications for image collections. Working with their digital archives, I produced new media by synthesising vast collections into representational models and brought archive images to life by combining them with state-of-the-art machine learning models.

The library's framing of this project as an 'artist-in-residence' programme became a significant part of the organisation's social media strategy during the pandemic. The content I produced amassed over 100,000 views on social media (59,000 from NLS accounts and 49,000 from my personal account) and one of the artworks produced was nominated for a John Byrne Award.

"*Martin’s residency with the National Library of Scotland has been a great success. Martin’s work has brought new methods and approaches to the Library’s digitised collections, encouraging us to consider the role of AI and machine learning in constructing new realities, worlds and truths – while simultaneously bringing the Library’s collections themselves under critical examination. We hope that this will only be the beginning of creative uses of the Library’s digital and data collections by artists such as Martin, exploring the new possibilities that the intersection of computational methods and creativity offers to cultural heritage collections.*" - Sarah Ames, Digital Scholarship Librarian

### Modelling Image Collections
<br/>
Cultural institutions often hold vast archives of material which are difficult to curate. The demands of the attention economy are such that hidden value in these collections often goes unrealised. Creative machine learning applications offer a unique solution to realising this value with a novel public engagement solution. I have developed the following techniques for working with vast collections.

#### Machine learning visualisations
<br/>
Machine learning applications can be used to visualise vast collections. Below is a t-SNE-based rendering of similarity within a subset of the NLS map collection. The result is an intricate mosaic pattern that intuitively and aesthetically communicates the distribution of images in the collection.

#### Generative stylistic modelling

Detail can often be lost when communicating scale; generative modelling of image collections offers a solution to this. After being trained on a collection of images, these machine learning models are able to produce convincing fakes of the training data. This process results in the creation of complex, representative models of the collections which can produce the dynamic and eye-catching animations seen below.

#### Animating Image Collections

As well as working with vast collections at scale, I also work with individual archive images, bringing them to life in dynamic ways.

#### Rendering archival images in 3D

This technique creates a depth model of a given image. A virtual camera can then traverse the space as if it were 3D.

#### Deep fake portrait animation

Combining a 'driver' video with a source image renders a new video combining the expressive facial movement of the driver video with the likeness of the source image. This technique can be very effective in combination with a voice actor for animating historical figures.
